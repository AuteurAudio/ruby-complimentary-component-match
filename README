                A Ruby Complimentary Component Value Matcher
		--------------------------------------------


Overview:	Simple library for matching complimentary component
		values.  These are input by way of two arrays.  
		Value comparisons are absolute terms only.  There
		is a convenience printing method, and of course
		an accessor for the array-based matching data for
		use in other applications. 	

Method:		Iterative selection of closes match within a given
		tolerance threshold until there are no more matches
		or the input arrays are depleted.		

Examples:	To run the example:	

		   ruby match_csv.rb test.csv 0.1

		   test.csv is any CSV file with two columns, one
		      for the first group of values, one for the 
		      second.

		   0.1 is the threshold in absolute terms.
