            A Ruby Complimentary Component Value Matcher
            --------------------------------------------


Overview:   Simple library for matching complimentary component
            values.  These are input by way of two arrays.  
            Value comparisons are absolute terms only.  There
            is a convenience printing method, and of course
            an accessor for the array-based matching data for
            use in other applications.  

Method:     Iterative selection of closest matches within a given
            tolerance threshold until there are no more matches
            or the input arrays are depleted.       

Examples:   To run the example: 

                ruby example.rb example.csv 0.1

            example.csv is any CSV file with two columns, one
                for the first group of values, one for the 
                second.

            0.1 is the threshold in absolute terms.
